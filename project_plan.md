Medical Imaging Report Generator (Agentic Pipeline)
Phase 1: Setup & Research (Week 1)

âœ… Learn basics of LangGraph and how to define agent nodes + edges.

âœ… Read 1â€“2 research papers on automatic radiology report generation (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR baselines).

âœ… Choose dataset:

MIMIC-CXR (large, chest X-rays + radiology reports).

Alternative: Indiana University Chest X-ray Dataset (smaller, easier to start).

âœ… Tools: Python, PyTorch/Transformers, LangChain + LangGraph, FAISS (optional for retrieval).

Phase 2: Image Analysis Agent (Week 2â€“3)

í¾¯ Goal: Extract abnormalities / features from input image.

Options:

Pretrained Medical Vision Models

CheXNet (DenseNet-121) â†’ detects 14 chest diseases.

MedCLIP (imageâ€“text embeddings).

SAM (Segment Anything Model) for region highlighting (optional).

Implementation Steps

Load pretrained CheXNet (or ViT fine-tuned on MIMIC).

Input: Chest X-ray â†’ Output: List of predicted findings (e.g., â€œOpacity in left lower lung, possible pneumoniaâ€).

Store structured JSON output for next agent.

Phase 3: Report Drafting Agent (Week 4â€“5)

í¾¯ Goal: Convert structured findings â†’ natural language radiology-style report.

Approach:

Use LangGraph to create an agent with an LLM (LLaMA-2, GPT-4, or BioGPT).

Input: JSON findings + patient metadata â†’ Output: Structured report sections:

Impression

Findings

Comparison (optional if historical data available).

Example:

{
  "Findings": "Opacity in left lower lobe, cardiac silhouette normal.",
  "Impression": "Findings consistent with possible pneumonia."
}

Phase 4: Consistency Checker Agent (Week 6)

í¾¯ Goal: Ensure generated report aligns with detected abnormalities.

Steps:

Use an LLM verification agent:

Input: Findings JSON + Report Text.

Task: Check if all abnormalities are covered in text, flag hallucinations.

Optionally: Use Natural Language Inference (NLI) model (e.g., RoBERTa-MNLI fine-tuned on clinical text).

Output: Either â€œConsistent âœ…â€ or â€œMismatch âš ï¸ (e.g., Report mentions pleural effusion not found in analysis)â€.

Phase 5: Pipeline Integration with LangGraph (Week 7â€“8)

í¾¯ Goal: Orchestrate the 3 agents into a working system.

Graph design:

Node 1: Image Analysis Agent â†’ abnormalities JSON.

Node 2: Report Drafting Agent â†’ full radiology report.

Node 3: Consistency Checker Agent â†’ verifies & corrects.

Output Node: Final structured report.

Implementation:

import langgraph

# Define nodes
analysis = ImageAnalysisAgent()
drafting = ReportDraftingAgent()
checker = ConsistencyCheckerAgent()

# Build graph
graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("analysis", analysis)
graph.add_node("drafting", drafting)
graph.add_node("checker", checker)

graph.add_edge("analysis", "drafting")
graph.add_edge("drafting", "checker")

graph.set_entry_point("analysis")
graph.set_finish_point("checker")

Phase 6: Evaluation (Week 9â€“10)

í¾¯ Metrics:

BLEU / ROUGE â†’ for comparing generated reports with ground-truth reports (from MIMIC).

RadGraph F1 Score â†’ measures correctness of clinical entities in generated report.

Human evaluation (if possible): compare to real radiologist reports.

Visualization: Show:

Original X-ray.

Detected findings (highlighted regions).

Generated report.

Ground truth report.

Phase 7: Portfolio Packaging (Week 11â€“12)

Build demo app (Streamlit or Gradio).

Upload image â†’ See pipeline in action.

Show intermediate outputs (agent graph execution trace).

Write documentation & blog post:

Problem â†’ Approach â†’ Pipeline â†’ Results.

GitHub: Publish code + trained models + demo notebooks.

Extra: Deploy on HuggingFace Spaces for easy recruiter access.

í´‘ Final Deliverables

âœ… Code repo (well-documented).

âœ… Demo app (upload image â†’ get report).

âœ… Technical blog post (â€œBuilding an Agentic Medical Report Generator with LangGraphâ€).

âœ… Visual pipeline diagram (agents + flow).
